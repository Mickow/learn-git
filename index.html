            <p>There's a Lady who's sure all that glitters is gold<br>
                And she's buying a stairway to heaven.<br>
                When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed<br>
                With a word she can get what she came for.<br>
                <br>
                Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.<br>
                <br>
                There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure<br>
                'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.<br>
                In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,<br>
                Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.<br>
                <br>
                Ooh, it makes me wonder x2<br>
                <br>
                There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,<br>
                And my spirit is crying for leaving.<br>
                In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,<br>
                And the voices of those who stand looking.<br>
                <br>
                Ooh, it makes me wonder,<br>
                Ooh, really makes me wonder.<br>
                <br>
                And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune<br>
                Then the piper will lead us to reason.<br>
                And a new day will dawn for those who stand long<br>
                And the forests will echo with laughter.<br>
                <br>
                Ooh...<br>
                <br>
                If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,<br>
                It's just a spring clean for the May queen.<br>
                Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run<br>
                There's still time to change the road you're on.<br>
                <br>
                And it makes me wonder.<br>
                Ooh...<br>
                <br>
                Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,<br>
                The piper's calling you to join him,<br>
                Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know<br>
                Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                And as we wind on down the road<br>
                Our shadows taller than our souls.<br>
                There walks a lady we all know<br>
                Who shines white light and wants to show<br>
                How everything still turns to gold.<br>
                And if you listen very hard<br>
                The tune will come to you at last.<br>
                When all are one and one is all<br>
                To be a rock and not to roll.<br>
                <br>
                And she's buying a stairway to heaven...</p>
